# 🛠️ HOW IT'S MADE

Tech Stack: CSS, React, Next, Solana Wallet Adapter, Web3.js
<br></br>

I built this project leveraging next.js. I added the Solana Wallet Adapter and web3.js to create the following scaffold features:

- Simple Transaction Component
- Wallet Integeration
- Navigation Pages
- Simple Styling

# 🤔 GETTING STARTED

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

After forking this repo, install the dependencies by using this command in the terminal:

```
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### 🏃🏾‍♀️ RUN LOCALLY

Run the development server by using this command in the terminal:

```
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```


Open [local host](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
