# 🛠️ HOW IT'S MADE

Tech Stack: CSS, React, Next, Solana Wallet Adapter, Web3.js
<br></br>

I built this project leveraging next.js. I added the Solana Wallet Adapter and web3.js to create the following scaffold features:

- Simple Transaction Component
- Wallet Integration
- Navigation Pages
- Simple Styling

# 🤔 GETTING STARTED

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
