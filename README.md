# 🛠️ HOW IT'S MADE

Tech Stack: CSS, React, Next, Solana Wallet Adapter, thirdweb Solana SDK
<br></br>

I built this project leveraging next.js. I added the Solana Wallet Adapter and thirdweb Solana SDK to create this NFT scavenger hunt as a complementary example to my Sol.Ladies Hacker House workshop titled Gamifying Solana NFT Drops.
